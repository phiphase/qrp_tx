# 1 W 40m CW Transmitter
This transmitter is based on the "Buildathon" QRP 40m Transmitter (Tx) from Chapter 22, QRP Basics.
However, it has an extra buffer stage and some other modifications.
It produces 1 W average power from the 2N3866 PA. It is currently equipped with a manual T/R change-over switch but
this may be changed in future to an RF detecting automatic T/R switch.
